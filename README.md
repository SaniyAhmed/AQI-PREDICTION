# AQI-PREDICTION
This project is an end-to-end, automated Machine Learning system designed to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) for Karachi, Pakistan, for the next 3 days. It uses a completely serverless stack, meaning no manual intervention is required for data collection, model training, or deployment.
